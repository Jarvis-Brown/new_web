                                I'm an Animator and a Fullstack Designer in
                                Philadelphia, PA with roots in St. Louis, MO.
                                I'm passionate about working on designs and
                                animations that improve lives and have a
                                positive social impact. I design in a
                                human-centric way, incorporating user research
                                and practical choices for user interfaces. I
                                draw design inspiration from my favorite brands
                                and trends, using my Master's in Fine Arts, to
                                add a creative touch to everything I do.

                                Early on in life, I knew I wanted to be an
                                artist and bring my drawings to life in a
                                digital format. I started my career in animation
                                after completing my studies at the Chicago
                                Illinois Institute of the Arts. I traveled from
                                Chicago to San Francisco in pursuit of animation
                                and received my MFA from the Academy of Art.
                                Afterward, I moved between LA and the Bay Area
                                working on various projects before moving to New
                                York where I've worked as a character animator
                                and motion graphics designer for the last 6
                                years.

                                After working in the Animation field for 8
                                years, I decided to pursue a career as a
                                Fullstack Designer to grow my artistic skillset
                                further. I attended the CareerFoundry to gain
                                certification in UI Design and have been
                                currently working on projects to diversify my
                                portfolio. After completing certification I
                                attended Coding Dojo to gain certification in
                                Fullstack Development.

                                painting, drawing, and researching the newest
                                techniques in digital art. On any given weekend
                                I can be found walking around my newest city,
                                visiting museums, and finding inspiration in the
                                world around me.
